FTC Tester
GNU PL V3

Just a quick little java app that runs on the driver station for FTC Robots, used to check motors and test run them. Use at your own will, i really dont care. I just made this because my teams builders always need something tested.


Controls:
Dpad Up/Down = Select a Motor
Right Stick X = Selected Motors Power
A = Toggles Selected Motors Power/Servo Position To 1 or 0 if already selected
B = Sets selected Motor or Servo to 0

Configuration used with this app:
