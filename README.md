FTC Tester
-------------

Just a quick little java app that runs on the driver station for FTC Robots, used to check motors and test run them. Use at your own will, i really dont care.  Please note that it may not work on some phones due to telemetry being too big, However I've kept it small enough that it should work on most phones

Controls:\
Dpad Up/Down = Select a Motor\
Right Stick Y = Selected Motors Power\
Right/Left Bumpers = Changes menu between motor/servo
